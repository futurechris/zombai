ZombAI - Zombie AI Simulator
============================

ZombAI is a project exploring level-of-detail as applied to situations
with a high number of autonomous agents that the player is *not*
interacting with.

The LOD aspect is intended to ameliorate potentially heavy demands on
limited system resources - mobile CPUs, for example - while still
allowing for high-quality artificial intelligence algorithms.

Of course, LOD is only one tiny part of this puzzle, but here we are.

Although this project is built in Unity, I will endeavor to partition
the actual algorithms from the bits used to display the simulated world.
